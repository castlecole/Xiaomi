# Xiaomi
Repository of SmartThings device handlers for Xiaomi Devices. Huge thanks to a4refillpad for creating these. I have made alterations to look and parameter access for my own use, but you are free to use if you so wish.

The devices are difficult to get paired initially. Plenty of information https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-xiaomi-sensors-and-button-beta/77576

<b>Note:</b> a4refillpad did not recommend the outlets, as they appear to make the system less stable. However, other people do not seem to report this. I am based in the Uk, so the outlets are no use to me at 240v, so I have not tested them.
